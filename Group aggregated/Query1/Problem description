The sales manager would like reports that include aggregated information about product sales.

    Retrieve total sales by product
        Write a query to retrieve a list of the product names from the SalesLT.Product table and the total revenue for each product calculated as the sum of 
        LineTotal from the SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table, with the results sorted in descending order of total revenue.
    Filter the product sales list to include only products that cost over 1,000
        Modify the previous query to include sales totals for products that have a list price of more than 1000.
    Filter the product sales groups to include only total sales over 20,000
