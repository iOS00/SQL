Challenge 1: Generate invoice reports


Adventure Works Cycles sells directly to retailers, who must be invoiced for their orders. You have been tasked with writing a query to generate a list of invoices to be sent to customers.

    Retrieve customer orders
        As an initial step towards generating the invoice report, write a query that returns the company name from the SalesLT.Customer table, and the sales order ID and total due from the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table.
    Retrieve customer orders with addresses
        Extend your customer orders query to include the Main Office address for each customer, including the full street address, city, state or province, postal code, and country or region
        Tip: Note that each customer can have multiple addressees in the SalesLT.Address table, so the database developer has created the SalesLT.CustomerAddress table to enable a many-to-many relationship between customers and addresses. Your query will need to include both of these tables, and should filter the results so that only Main Office addresses are included.
