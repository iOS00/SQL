Adventure Works products each have a standard cost price that indicates the cost of manufacturing the product, and a list price that indicates the recommended selling
price for the product. This data is stored in the SalesLT.Product table. Whenever a product is ordered, the actual unit price at which it was sold is also recorded 
in the SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table. 
You must use subqueries to compare the cost and list prices for each product with the unit prices charged in each sale.

Retrieve Products with a list price of 100 or more that have been sold for less than 100.

    Retrieve the product ID, name, and list price for each product where the list price is 100 or more, and the product has been sold for less than 100.
