The standard cost of a product and the unit price at which it is sold determine its profitability. You must use correlated subqueries to compare the cost and 
average selling price for each product.
Retrieve products that have an average selling price that is lower than the cost. 
â€¢	Filter your previous query to include only products where the cost price is higher than the average selling price.
